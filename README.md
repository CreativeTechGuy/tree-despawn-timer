# Mute All

Mute all sounds from playing, while still enabling sound events for other plugins

Some plugins listen to RuneLite events from sound effects being played. Unfortunately, this doesn't work if you have the
in-game sound effect settings muted. This plugin enables you to use these other plugins effectively while still having
muted sound effects. (Pairs nicely with [Watchdog Alerts](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/watchdog) Sound Fired
alert trigger.)

**NOTE**: For this plugin to work, you must manually unmute your Sound Effects and Area Sounds. If these are muted,
other Plugins won't get any Sound Effect events.
